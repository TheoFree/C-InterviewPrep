Main game loop logic:

1. check if previous move put you in check
    if yes -> have to move to get out of check 
        L Must check there exists a move that can be made to get king out of check.
            L if yes, let player attempt move and check that that is one of the valid moves.
            L else, checkmate, game over.
    if no -> continue.
2. player attempts regular move.
3. if regular move attempted is valid, check to see if that put opponent king in check.
    if yes -> set flag for opponents next move (1.)
    else -> continue to next turn.

Need to create:
    **Method that checks that input move doesn't put your own king in check. 
    Method that determines what the set of valid moves to get the king out of check will be. 
        - Save the piece that put the king in check to see what move will work?
        - Use function from before. 
        - options for getting out of check:
            * Move king
            * capture threat
            * block threat
